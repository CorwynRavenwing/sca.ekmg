These pics show the progression of a silversmithing project where I made four goblets by milling out silver ingots into workable sheet, and then proceeded to to the barrage of forming and soldering required to make the vessels water tight. These Goblets were used as prizes for the 2012 Gem Joust (Ruby Joust 1) in the Barony of Cear Mear, Atlantia.
