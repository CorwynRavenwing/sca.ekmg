<strong>From the East and North:</strong> Find your best route, Route 15 South to Lewisburg. Proceed to and turn onto Route 45 West. <!-- single asterisk goes here? --> Proceed west on Route 45 West, passing through the towns of Mifflinburg and Hartleton (beware of speed traps!).
<br />
<br />** At the intersection of Route 235 South, turn left. (SCA signs will be posted from this point.) From this turn, follow signs for 235 South for approximately 3 miles through Laurelton (last chance for food, gas, and ATM) and Glen Iron.

Turn right onto Creek Road at the 4-way intersection past this last 90-degree turn. Penn's Creek should be on your left. Stay on this road for approximately three miles; you will pass a large 3 story stone house with three arches, on your right, at this point you are about one mile from the Camp. After you pass Penn's Creek Campground on your right, turn right at the sign for Thomas Dam Road/Boy Scout Camp. Camp Karoondinha is on the left, up the hill. Troll will be located at the Dining Hall; look for the Troll sign.
