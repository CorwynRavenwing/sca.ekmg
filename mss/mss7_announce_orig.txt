Not sure why its not on the website yet. But here it is:

As the seasons turn cooler we look to celebrate 
Veturnætur (otherwise known as Winter Nights), 
the Norse harvest festival.  Join us for a day of 
All Things Viking and enjoy the last games before 
retiring to your longhouse for the cold months ahead.

We'll be culling our herds and devouring the 
crops that won't keep, so join us for a 
scrumptous feast prepared by Reyni-Hrefna.  A 
proper Viking feast is planned.  If you have any 
dietary restrictions you may contact her 
(Jennifer Johnson, karstyl@gmail.com, 
607-351-9860 no calls after 9pm).  Seating is 
limited, so you may wish to reserve early.

We are pleased to announce the incorporation of 
the AEthelmearc Metalsmith Guild's First Metal 
Symposium.  A variety of classes and activities 
are in the works.  Forge space is available.  For 
more details contact THL Captain John Michael Thorpe.

Martial activities for the day will include such 
Viking feats as armoured combat, thrown weapons, archery, and youth
combat.

Of course, other activities and games will be 
available for the youth and adults alike.

The site will open at 9am and close at 
9pm.  Reservations may be sent to the autocrat, 
Gytha Oggsdottir (Lori Baird, 305 Blackstone Ave, 
Ithaca NY 14850, gytha@tigerfire.net, 
607-257-4594).  The day fee is $8 for adults, 
half price for children under 17.  Under 5 is 
free.  Fees for our sumptuous feast are $8 for 
adults, half price for children under 12.  Under 
5 is free.  Family cap is set at $52.  The NMS is 
in effect as usual, $3 must be collected for all 
adults who cannot show proof of membership.  The 
only good reservation is a paid reservation.

Merchant space is available.  Contact the autocrat for more details.

Directions to the site: We are at 4H Acres in 
Ithaca, NY. From Rt. 79 WEST, drive down the hill 
until you reach Rt. 13 Drive North on 13 past the 
airport. At the third cross-road (Lower Creek 
Road), there will be a sign pointing left to 4-H 
Acres. It will be close on the left hand side of 
the street. Address: 418 Lower Creek Road
