<h2>Metal symposium in Myrkfaelinn</h2>

As the seasons turn cooler we look to celebrate 
Veturn√¶tur (otherwise known as Winter Nights), 
the Norse harvest festival.  Join us for a day of 
All Things Viking and enjoy the last games before 
retiring to your longhouse for the cold months ahead.
<br /><br />
We'll be culling our herds and devouring the 
crops that won't keep, so join us for a 
scrumptous feast prepared by Reyni-Hrefna.  A 
proper Viking feast is planned.  If you have any 
dietary restrictions you may contact her 
(Jennifer Johnson, karstyl@gmail.com, 
607-351-9860 no calls after 9pm).  Seating is 
limited, so you may wish to reserve early.
<br /><br />
We are pleased to announce the incorporation of 
the AEthelmearc Metalsmith Guild's First Metal 
Symposium.  A variety of classes and activities 
are in the works.  Forge space is available.  For 
more details contact THL Captain John Michael Thorpe.
<br /><br />
Martial activities for the day will include such 
Viking feats as armoured combat, thrown weapons, archery, and youth
combat.
<br /><br />
Of course, other activities and games will be 
available for the youth and adults alike.
