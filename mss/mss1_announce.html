Firing will occur on Saturday and will be an all-day activity.  There will be a ample chance to ask questions throughout the process.  We will be having the traditional weenie roast over the out blast, so bring your long handled roasting forks!

Description:
Equipment needed:  Students should bring their favorite 1.5# - 2# hammer if they have one, and ear protection

Class:  Beginning Tool Making
Teacher:  Dion
Students:
Duration:
Description:  the making of tools - the attendees could select projects individually
from a list, and go home with a finished tool, like:
an awl/punch/scribe

Class:  Building your own Brake drum forge (Lecture class)
Teacher:Philippa Alderton 
Students:15
Duration:  2 hours

Class:  Chasing and Repousse'
Teacher:  Mistress Brianna Yseulte Wynman (Jan Wyman)
Students:  6
Duration:  1 hour
Description:  This is a method used since ancient times to sculpt metal.  The same simple hand tools used in period are used here - a chasing hammer and some dapping dies/chasing tools.  This method can be used inside a goblet to create a scene on the sides, or on a piece of jewelry - it has wide applications.  Most of the work is done in reverse, on the back - 'bumping' up the metal from the back, and selectively pushing it back down again from the front.  This class will teach you the basics, or help improve your skill if you've already tried it.
Tools:  bring 'em if you've got 'em!  chasing tools, chasing hammer, block of lead, pitch bowl, dapping dies.  I'll bring my mini torch for annealing or heating the pitch, and some brass to practice on.  This one really doesn't lend itself to a class paper, unfortunately.  There's just not a whole lot you can put down on paper for this - you really have to see it.

Class:  Wax Carving Techniques
Teacher:  Mistress Brianna Yseulte Wynman (Jan Wyman)
Students:  12 Intermediate to Expert, sculpting or woodcarving experience helpful.
Duration:  2 hours
Any period or style can be created in this manner.  How thick to make your model, how to measure it, how to create settings.  Some sneaky short-cuts.  Make rings, small sculptures for jewelry (such as animal heads for torcs), pendants, many other objects can be made with this technique.
A class paper will be provided, which will include research on what mainly English signet rings looked like, with steps for making one.

Class:  Cold Forging a Bowl or a Spoon
Teacher:  Mistress Brianna Yseulte Wynman (Jan Wyman)
Students:  6
Duration:  4 hours
These are the same methods used in period by Silversmiths and Goldsmiths to raise/sink metals to create drinking vessels, spoons, etc.  The metal is worked cold, rather than heated as you would with iron or steel.  Annealing will be demonstrated using a modern torch (for convenience), and you will be taught how to and when to anneal.  How to make a 2-piece medieval spoon, or a low bowl.
Tools:  dapping dies, wood blocks, wooden hammers
A class paper will be provided, which will include the basics for laying out a circle to sink a bowl (which can be made into a chalice, goblet or bowl) of a certain size, basic directions on sinking and raising, a pattern for making either a 2-piece or 1 piece medieval spoon.

Duration:  2 hours (hands-on)
Tools:  Nothing needed
Description:  Get all the information you need to hand-carve soapstone molds and cast
hot molten metal in them.  Covers everything from where to get the basic equipment to hands-on carving of your own mold and casting a simple token of your own design.  Uses period materials and methods, though some modern forms of hand tools (no power tools).

Class:  Beginning Metal Etching (suitable for children too)
Teacher:  Mistress Aine Callaghan, OP
Students:  Class size 6 beginners at a time 
Children under 13 yrs old must be accompanied by an adult until I determine that they have the attention span to leave them with me alone
Duration:  1 - 2 hours
We will be etching designs on circular medallions using acrylic paint and etching them in ferric chloride acid.  The technique is easy, but due to the limitations of the acrylic paint designs with tiny details are difficult to accomplish.  It takes about 1 hour to decide on and paint the design on the medallion, then another hour for it to etch.  This will be an on-going demo/workshop, so you can leave and come back to collect your medallion at the end of the etching time.

Class:  Trichinolopy chainwork (a.k.a Viking or wire chain knitting)
Teacher:  Apollonia Voss
Students:limited to 8 gentles so as to provide maximum one on one instruction
Duration:  2 hours
We will use copper wire to learn a structured "knitting" technique, known as trichinopoly chain work, used by Vikings to create jewelry.  This technique produces beautiful "tubes" of knitted metal that can be used to create necklaces, earrings, rings, or decorative lengths of chain.  
If you have wire cutters and/or jewelry pliers (chain nose, flat nose, or round nose) please bring them.
