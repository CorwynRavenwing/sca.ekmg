Hosted by Shire of Frosted Hills - Salt Point, NY


Event Last Modified: October 3rd, 2005

We are pleased to invite you to come for an exciting weekend of dirty classes that don't fit into a regular schola or EKU format.  In addition to hosting the 4th Metalsmiths Symposium, we anticipate having classes in almost any other craft, including lampwork, pottery, woodworking, leatherwork etc.  If it's dirty, or involves heat or needs a large space, we plan to have it.  

If you are interested in teaching a class, please contact the autocrat.  We are pleased to note that Carowyn Silveroak will be assisting us with the planning of this event.
