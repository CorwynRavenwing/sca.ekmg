Greetings!<br />
<br />
Last weekend (July 21, 2007), I received the King's and Queen's Cypher scroll that was
given to the Guild from King Lucan and Queen Jana.
<br />
<br />
The pics I took of the scroll, as well as of the cyphers themselves,
are here:

I'm still not sure
who-all gets to wear them; I'll find out after Pennsic, when everyone's
home again.  But till then, here's the text:

<h3>******************** TEXT OF CYPHER SCROLL ********************</h3>
<blockquote>
	<font size="4" color="blue">
	Who does not shine when in our fair Queen's radiating beauty?  Indeed all
	can find hope and courage when such inspiration stands before them.  Yet
	what does the common man do when Her fair visage is removed and the world
	presses its resolve?  To take her example with them in their heart is
	valiant and true, as all men face trials in this world.  Even mighty
	Lancelot did firm his resolve by carrying token of his Gueneviere.  To
	bestow her favor any Queen must procure a symbol, and such a symbol was
	provided unto Her Grace and by extension unto Our Kingdom by the many
	good gentles of the Metal Smything Guild.  They have labored in her honor
	making tokens of great wonder such that She might inspire all throughout
	Her reign.
	<br />
	<br />
	Kingdoms' legacies are built of many things: Prowess, Chivalry, Honor,
	and Valor.  Fortunate as well is the King who is recalled for his acts of
	Generosity.  Long will Lucan be remembered for the largesse displayed by
	the gift of arm rings to His people, as well the product of the honored
	Guild.
	<br />
	<br />
	Without the devotion of these artisans, the gift coffers of the Eastern
	Monarchs would be far lighter as other items from their hands
	demonstrating both art and skill represent the Kingdom both at home and
	abroad.  As well among the Metal Smiths offerings one finds the
	harmonious Terpsichore bells to decorate many a deserving recipient.
	<br /><br />
	Fortunate recipients of these gifts abound.  So for these innumerable
	favors do We, Lucan and Jana, King and Queen of the East, demonstrate
	Their favor in return, awarding unto Their Metal Smithing both the King's
	and Queen's Cypher this fourteenth day of April anno societatis forty one
	in their bounteous Barony of Bergental at Their Last Court.
	<br /><br />
	Lucan VII<br />
	Jana IIII<br />
