	  What follows is the Guild Charter for the East Kingdom
	  Metalsmiths' Guild.  By East Kingdom Law, the signatures of
	  a reigning King and Queen upon a guild charter, turn that guild
	  into a Royal Guild.
	  <br />
	  <br />
	  The Charter itself is an impressive piece of metalwork, and
	  as such it will be on display at events as often as practical.
	  Come see it!

<font size="4">
<p>Be it proclaimed throughout the Kingdom of the East that We,
Thorson and Svava, King and Queen of the East, hereby grant unto
the East Kingdom Metalsmiths' Guild a Charter.  It shall be the
duty of this Guild to serve the East Kingdom as an open forum for
the exchange of information on the Metalsmithing Arts and Lore of
the Current and Then Middle Ages.  It is Our pleasure that
membership in this Guild be open to any of Our subjects who
express interest in the Arts and Sciences of the Casting or
Working of Metals, Common or Noble, as well as their Alloys;
or of the Working of Glass; or of the Making of Jewelry.</p>

<p>It is Our wish that the Guild shall serve the Kingdom as a
resource in all matters appropriate to these Arts.  Therefore
We charge the members of this Guild with the responsibility of
sharing their knowledge and skills with all of Our subjects who
may wish to approach them for this purpose.</p>

<p>We direct the Guild to institute a voluntary system of
certification and ranking on the basis of knowledge and expertise,
assigning ranking levels through a system of panelling by the
Masters of the Guild.  The public face of the Guild shall be
represented by a Guildmistress, through whom the Guild is directed
to foster the goals herein outlined, making themselves available
for the education and enlightenment of any who so desire.</p>

<p>Signed this day the 8th of January, Anno Societatis XXXIX, at
East Kingdom Twelfth Night in the Barony of Dragonship Haven.</p>
