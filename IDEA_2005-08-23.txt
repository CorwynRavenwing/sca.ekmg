(15:37:29) Carowyn: I had a thought....
(15:38:11) Carowyn: On the EKMG site, I'd also like to put cool sci-fi books that have gem, jewelry, forging, glass themes with reviews
(15:48:22) Carowyn: Do you think it's a good idea?
(15:50:06) Corwyn: it would be cool -- i'm trying to see where it would fit into the site
(15:52:30) Carowyn: Yeah, like a "Book Reviews" section off the library....
(15:53:23) Corwyn: definitely doable
(15:53:25) Carowyn: Split into different sections, maybe, with "Sci-Fi and Fantasy with Metalsmithing Themes" as a sub-heading???
(15:54:20) Corwyn: ? that sounds like a category all such reviews could fit into, not a subheading :confusion:
(15:55:00) Carowyn: Well, I was wondering if people want to do reviews of the library books, or books on EKMG topics in personal libraries....
(15:55:19) Carowyn: "Lightbown rocks, Melody sucks" sort if thing
(16:02:38) Corwyn: okay, so what you're talking about is a "book reviews" section with headings for each of the "serious" book headings; plus an additional "SF/Fantasy" heading
(16:06:06) Carowyn: that's what I was thinking - if I'm getting ahead of myself, you can tell me "no"
(16:07:55) Corwyn: not really.  it just felt like you started in the middle of the explanation, but i think i've caught up :-)
