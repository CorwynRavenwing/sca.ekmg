<h3>Gifts Made for Other People</h3>

<font size=4>
  This page documents gifts made by one or more Guild members,
  in the name of the guild, to be given to someone as a gift,
  usually but not always Their Majesties.

<a name="mirrors"><h3>Hand Mirrors</h3></a>

<font size=4>
  This project was performed for Their Majesties Kelson II & Geneviere II.
  They were made of wood, with a space carved out for a mirror (modern
  silvered glass rather than period polished silver: chosen for utility,
  for cost, and for speed.)  Appropriate images, including the personal
  devices of His and Her Majesty, were wood-burned into the face and back
  of the mirror frame.  They were presented in court at "Alles Faire in Love
  and War", AS XL.
