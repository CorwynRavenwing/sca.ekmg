<h1 align="center">East Kingdom Metalsmiths' Guild</h1>

<h3 align="center">What are we?</h3>
<font size="4">The East Kingdom Metalsmiths' Guild is dedicated to
the study and teaching of all the metalsmithing arts and sciences:
blacksmithing, smelting, casting, working in various metals,
jewelrymaking, glassblowing, glass lampworking (beads, etc.), and the like.
</font>

<h3 align="center">What is our history?</h3>
<font size="4">The guild was founded as a local shire-level group
(called the <i>Silver Rylle</i> Metalsmiths' Guild)
in approximately Anno Societatis XXXIV (2000).  Having gained
momentum and membership ever since then, it attracted attention from
people outside the shire, and when they joined the Guild, it could no
longer retain its provincial name.  After a short stint as the
<i>Southern Region</i> Metalsmiths' Guild, it was finally renamed the
<i>East Kingdom</i> Metalsmiths' Guild, and its Royal Guild charter
was signed at Kingdom Twelfth Night, Jan 8th, A.S. XXXIX (2005).
</font>

<h3 align="center">How do I get involved?</h3>
<font size="4">If you wish to learn any of the arts and sciences
of metalsmithing, contact any guild member, who will connect you with
someone knowledgeable in the field you wish to learn; if you don't know
any guild members, feel free to contact the
<a href="mailto:guildmistress@ekmg.eastkingdom.org">Guildmistress</a>,
who will be glad to introduce you.
</font>

<h3 align="center">Do I have to join the Guild to learn something?</h3>
<font size="4">Certainly not!  The Guild has been charged by our
Charter to share their knowledge with any subject of the Kingdom who
approaches them and asks to be taught.  You have no obligation to become
a guild member in order to be taught by one.  Come along with us and have
fun!
</font>

<h3 align="center">How do I join the Guild?</h3>
<font size="4">Anyone who expresses a desire to join the ranks of the Guild
is certainly welcome to do so.  Guild members are encouraged to
teach others, but it is not required that you excel in every subject.  If
someone approaches you to learn something that you don't feel competent
to teach, you may instead refer them to another teacher or to the
Guildmistress.  You may also choose to become an Associate Member,
stating that you wish to be affiliated with the Guild without claiming
an explicit Guild Membership if that wouldn't suit your persona or your
personality.  In either case, contact the
<a href="mailto:guildmistress@ekmg.eastkingdom.org">Guildmistress</a>,
Lady Carowyn Silveroak, and let her know you're interested in joining.
</font>

<h3 align="center">But I'm not a Laurel or a Maunche, can I still join?</h3>
<font size="4">Of course!  You don't have to be any sort of expert to join
the Guild.  If you know something, even at a basic level, you can teach it
to those who don't know it at all.  And if you don't know something, you
can learn from those who do, and then turn around and teach it!  It's not
knowledge itself we're looking for: it's the <u>love</u> of knowledge, and
the willingness to learn and to teach.  Come join us!

<h3 align="center">What's this I hear about a metal charter?</h3>
<font size="4">What else would you make the charter out of for a guild
of metalworkers?  The charter is done in repousse and enamel on brass.
If you want to see it, His Majesty has charged the Guildmistress with
displaying it at as many events as possible, so you may just come across
it at an event near you.  If you don't get a chance to see the original,
a photograph of the <a href="docs/charter.html"><b>charter</b></a>, along with a transcription of the text,
can be found here.
